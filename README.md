# City_Fight
old project in Java
We choose the map size, resources are generated on each field, then two cities 'A' and 'B' appear on the map. In each turn, the cities gain territory and fight against the opposing city. The more resources a city gathers, the faster it gains territory and increases its chances of winning against the other city. The simulation ends when one city captures the entire board.
Both the code and the comments are written in Polish, as it was required by the person evaluating the project.
